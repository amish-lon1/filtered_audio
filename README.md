# 🎧 Modulated Audio Signal Processing

## 📌 Objective
This project involves processing an amplitude-modulated (AM) audio signal to recover the original clean audio. Key steps include estimating the carrier frequency, demodulating the signal, applying a bandpass filter, and saving the cleaned result.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**
- **SciPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook (optional for visualization)**
